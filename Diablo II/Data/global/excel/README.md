# D2QOL | Soft Mods

Included in this folder are several "soft mods" that are popular in the D2 community.  While these days I prefer a purist D2 experience, these mods can be pretty fun and I've played them all.

These mods are separated into individual folders so you can pick and choose what you want.  None of these mods are turned on by default in this QOL modpack, you have to turn them on yourself.

To install any of these, just copy and paste the contents of the folder into the parent directory.  So the ``TXT`` files are going to end up in ``C:\Games\Diablo II\Data\Global\Excel\``.

## Summary

- ``BIGGERSTACKS`` - Increase stack sizes on keys, scrolls, and quivers.
- ``COUNTESSDROPS`` - Countess always drops 3 runes (w/ drop table improved).
- ``COUNTESSDROPS+NODROP0`` - Similar to ``/players 8`` where every mob drops something.
- ``CUBERUNESWOUTGEMS`` - Upgrade runes without the gem requirements.
- ``CUBERUNESWOUTGEMS+CUBESOCKETALLITEMS`` - Cube recipes for adding sockets work on magic, rare, unique, and set items too.
- ``DRUIDSKILLS`` - Shapeshift lasts longer and can summon all beasts at the same time.
- ``INFINITEQUIVERS+DRUIDSKILLS`` - Magic and rare quivers are possible and arrows are infinite.
- ``MERCSKILLS`` - All mercs get an aura: A1=Blesssed Aim, A3=Meditation, A5=Might.
- ``SHITFEST`` - Radically increases mob density in the game.
