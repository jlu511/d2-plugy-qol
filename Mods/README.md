# D2QOL | Soft Mods

Included in this folder are several "soft mods" that are popular in the D2 community which include changes to inventory, drops, mercenaries, skills, and more.

These mods are separated into individual folders so you can pick and choose what you want.  None of these mods are turned on by default in this modpack, you have to turn them on yourself.
