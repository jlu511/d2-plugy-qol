# D2QOL | Soft Mods

Included in this folder are several "soft mods" that are popular in the D2 community.  While these days I prefer a purist D2 experience, these mods can be pretty fun and I've played them all.

These mods are separated into individual folders so you can pick and choose what you want.  None of these mods are turned on by default in this QOL modpack, you have to turn them on yourself.

To install any of these, just copy and paste the contents into ``C:\Games\Diablo II\Data\Global\Excel\``.

NOTE: Parts of this mod aren't working as intended ATM and I hope to update once I've figured out why.

### CUBEMOD
- Upgrade runes w/ 2 of any rune -> 1 higher level rune, no gem requirements

- Unsocket any item in the cube w/ a key and get the runes back

### SPLASHMOD
- Adds jewels w/ melee splash damage to the game
- Uses new magic prefix "Brute's" and suffix "of the Brawler"
- Can be used on any item slot, not just weapons, to get the effect
- Seems to effect minions as well as the player (so say POD players)

If you use this mod, paste in these files before you paste in other mods.  None of the other mods in this repo will mess up your save files except for SPLASHMOD.  If you have a splash damage jewel on your character or in your inventory and you remove this mod, your save files will break.
